I am Karan, from New Delhi. I am in my final year undergraduate, majors in CS. I’m a backend developer and have done a Google Summer of Code with Python Software Foundation in 2016. I am presently working remotely for a startup- Supply.ai and the work is pretty similar to the job requirement at Instamojo. I am working with Django to design REST APIs amongst other backend related work. I am aware of the minimum 2 years of experience for this job but if you have any positions for junior developer, I’d be eager to apply for that. I am eager and open to learn a new tech stack and willing to put in effort. 

I’m attaching my resume link and Github profile if you’re interested.  
  
Thanks a lot.
