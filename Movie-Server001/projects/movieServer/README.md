# Instructions

### Note:
It's recommended to use virtualenv. For that simply follow instructions
- `python3 -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`

Once you have activated your `virtualenv` you can follow the instructions to install dependencies (Flask)

- `pip install requirements.txt`

To run the app on `local server`

- `python app.py`

The app is running on `http://localhost:5000/` now
